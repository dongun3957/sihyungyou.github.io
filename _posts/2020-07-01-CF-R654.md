### A. Magical Sticks  
time limit per test : 1 second  
memory limit per test : 256 megabytes  

A penguin Rocher has 𝑛 sticks. He has exactly one stick with length 𝑖 for all 1≤𝑖≤𝑛.  

He can connect some sticks. If he connects two sticks that have lengths 𝑎 and 𝑏, he gets one stick with length 𝑎+𝑏. Two sticks, that were used in the operation disappear from his set and the new connected stick appears in his set and can be used for the next connections.  

He wants to create the maximum number of sticks that have the same length. It is not necessary to make all sticks have the same length, some sticks can have the other length. How many sticks with the equal length he can create?  

Input  
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test cases. Next 𝑡 lines contain descriptions of test cases.  

For each test case, the only line contains a single integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤109).  

Output  
For each test case, print a single integer  — the answer to the problem.

n = 7이라고 할 때, 다음과 같이 답을 구할 수 있다.  
~~~
1 + 6 = 7
2 + 5 = 7
3 + 4 = 7
7
~~~

즉, 1부터 n-1까지의 수들을 합이 n이 되도록 짝지어 n에 따른 개수의 규칙을 찾아보면 아래와 같다.  
~~~
n 답
1 1
2 1
3 2
4 2
5 3
6 3
7 4
8 4
...
~~~

그러므로 n이 짝수라면 n/2개, 홀수라면 n/2+1개가 정답이다.  

### 코드  
~~~c++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    int n, i, t, j;

    scanf("%d", &t);
    for (j = 0; j < t; j++) {
        scanf("%d", &n);

        if (n % 2 == 0) printf("%d\n", n/2);
        else printf("%d\n", n/2 + 1);

### B. Magical Calendar  
time limit per test : 1 second  
memory limit per test : 256 megabytes  

A competitive eater, Alice is scheduling some practices for an eating contest on a magical calendar. The calendar is unusual because a week contains not necessarily 7 days!  

In detail, she can choose any integer 𝑘 which satisfies 1≤𝑘≤𝑟, and set 𝑘 days as the number of days in a week.  

Alice is going to paint some 𝑛 consecutive days on this calendar. On this calendar, dates are written from the left cell to the right cell in a week. If a date reaches the last day of a week, the next day's cell is the leftmost cell in the next (under) row.  

She wants to make all of the painted cells to be connected by side. It means, that for any two painted cells there should exist at least one sequence of painted cells, started in one of these cells, and ended in another, such that any two consecutive cells in this sequence are connected by side.  

Alice is considering the shape of the painted cells. Two shapes are the same if there exists a way to make them exactly overlapped using only parallel moves, parallel to the calendar's sides.  

For example, in the picture, a week has 4 days and Alice paints 5 consecutive days. [1] and [2] are different shapes, but [1] and [3] are equal shapes.

Alice wants to know how many possible shapes exists if she set how many days a week has and choose consecutive 𝑛 days and paints them in calendar started in one of the days of the week. As was said before, she considers only shapes, there all cells are connected by side.  

Input  
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test cases. Next 𝑡 lines contain descriptions of test cases.  

For each test case, the only line contains two integers 𝑛, 𝑟 (1≤𝑛≤109,1≤𝑟≤109).  

Output  
For each test case, print a single integer  — the answer to the problem.  

Please note, that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language.

r < n의 경우 1 + 2 + ... + (r - 1) + r, r >= n의 경우 1 + 2 + ... + (n - 1) + 1이 답이다.
