> Reducing Failure-Inducing Inputs  

By construction, fuzzers create inputs that may be hard to read. This causes issues during debugging, when a human has to analyze the exact cause of the failure. In this chapter, we present techniques that automatically reduce and simplify failure-inducing inputs to a minimum in order to ease debugging.
